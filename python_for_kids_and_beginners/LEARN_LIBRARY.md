# Python Lesson Library Overview

Mirror of the [waala.dev Lesson Library](https://www.waala.dev/learn/library). It gives mentors, parents, and contributors a human-readable tour of every daily drop inside the **Python Basics** program (84 total). Each entry pairs the day number, title, and quick intent so you can find the right lesson fast or draft GitHub practice files to match. When we add `/curriculum/python-for-kids/week-XX` folders, these summaries will map 1:1 with the practice files inside each week.
